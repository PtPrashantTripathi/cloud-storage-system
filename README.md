Data store is main future that cloud service provides to the companies to store huge amount of storage capacity. But still many companies or workstations are not ready to implement cloud computing technology due to lack of proper security control policy and weakness in protection which lead to many challenge in cloud computing. The primary objective of designing this data center or data storage is to learn the importance of accessing our data from anywhere around the world, create a secured & easy to handle storage for a small number of users, to prevent Data access from unauthorized access, and also performs some of the tasks like data updating, deleting, appending.   

## Technology use

- Android Studio, Sketchware.
- HTML5, CSS3, javascript & PaperCss for front-end development.
- Java for backend.
- Apache server for testing and development.
- Github for version control.
- Notepade++ text editor for coding

## Features

- User Interface 
   - Simple & Responsive UI
   - Easy storing, retrieval and updating of data   
- Data Security 
   - Data will be secured as data is stored directly in database as BLOB datatype.  
- File Types 
   - All types of data files can be stored  
   - Different file types will have different tags for proper segregation.  
- Navigation  
   - It offer a directory structure; this facilitates navigation and organization easily  
- Sharing 
   - File Sharing through WhatsApp  
- File versioning
